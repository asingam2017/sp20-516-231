### Wind energy
Wind energy uses wind turbines to generate power. 

Google uses power purchasing agreements to offset the cost of its datacenters even when their power needs cannot be directly met at all times by renewables. In 2017, their data center in Finland had a carbon-free day on which its power consumption was matched by Google-contracted wind energy (<https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-sustainability.appspot.com/pdf/24x7-carbon-free-energy-data-centers.pdf>).

Amazon goes one step further, building its own wind farms to power its datacenters (<https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/>).
