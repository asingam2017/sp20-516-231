### Wind energy
Wind energy uses wind turbines to generate power. 

Google uses power purchasing agreements to offset the cost of its datacenters even when their power needs cannot be directly met at all times by renewables. In 2017, their data center in Finland had a carbon-free day on which its power consumption was matched by Google-contracted wind energy (<https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-sustainability.appspot.com/pdf/24x7-carbon-free-energy-data-centers.pdf>).

Amazon goes one step further, building its own wind farms to power its datacenters (<https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/>).

### India
Under the Paris Agreement, India has a goal to generate at least 40% of its power from non-fossil sources. To help accomplish this, the Indian government charges a tax on produced and imported coal. As of 2017, investment in renewables has outpaced investment in fossil fuels. The government is also looking to implement solar-powered pumps in rural regions to support the use of renewable energy and increase profits for the farmers who use the pumps. Finally, the government recently announced an initiative called Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles, which will provide subsidies to support the purchase of electric cars

## E.Datacenter.8
In September 2018, lightning strikes interefered with a Microsoft data center in San Antonio, Texas, causing equipment to shut down and leading to an outage of Azure DevOps services. The outage affected 40 Azure services for the entire South Central US region and lasted over a day. Because Microsoft did not yet have Availability Zones in place in the South Central US region, there were no other data centers users could access during the outage.
